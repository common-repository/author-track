Earn Amazon affiliate money by allowing your users to setup automatic alerts that email them when the authors they have followed publish a new book.

== Description ==

An easy way for your book review site to earn more money! Now you can give your users an easy way to get notified when an author they like publishes a new book. The service is provided for free by Pushpig.

How it works:

1. You install and activate this plugin.
2. You add a short code with the author name and your Amazon Affiliate ID
3. A link is generated - after the reader clicks on it, they will be taken to a special page on Pushpig to sign-up. After they have, they will be returned to your site. In the future, they will receive an email whenever the author publishes a new book. The email contains a link to Amazon and uses your Amazon Affiliate ID, so you get the affilate money from Amazon!
